4. Additions made from tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqb-Ue7wpsI&t=3s


Levels: 
The tutorial only had 1 level, and we added 3 levels that focus on the 3 main dinosaur periods. 
All of the levels are different and have increasing difficulty. 
We modified the entire landscape by adding volcanoes, mountains, glaciers, plants, giant trees, giant mushrooms, grass, climbable structures, bridges, forests, lava, water, and ice. We also changed the colors of the skies for each level and made the terrain bigger. 
We also added animated Venus Flytraps all over the 1st level. 
We added a base that has a health recovery station, a table with the player's collected dinosaur statues, weapon decorations, and a button to advance to the next level. 

Objective: 
We added the ability to collect dinosaurs or "dinosaur DNA" in the game while fending off an attacking enemy. 
As the dinosaurs are collected, trophies are added to the table that starts out empty. 
It is not required to collect all dinosaurs. However, if you do not collect enough, the ending can alter from perfect to satisfactory to unfavorable. 

Enemy: 
We added a dragon enemy instead of the cannibal from the tutorial. The dragon patrols the ground, runs, and can attack and kill the player.

Health: 
We added the ability for health to be replenished by using a health station. 

Ending and other text: 
We added different endings that can be achieved depending on how many dinosaurs have been collected. 
These endings show up in form of text and tell the player their accomplishment. 
Additionally, the number of dinosaurs collected out of the total number of dinosaurs for that level can be seen in the upper left corner of the screen.

Sounds: 
We added various sounds. We added a sound for when the button is pushed, when the dinosaurs are collected, when the player gets hit, and when the dragon attacks and gets hit. 

Menu: 
We added a menu with the start, goal, and exit button.
